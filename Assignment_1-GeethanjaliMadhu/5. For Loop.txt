Genrally, a for loop has the following syntax:
  for(initilization; condition checking; reinitialization)
  {
    <loop body>
  }

We could have more than one counting variable in the initilization/reinitialization statement(s). Also, there can be more than one condition to check in each iteration, joined using either && or ||. Besides these, some additional operation on a variable can be written within the loop instead of in loop body (e.g. like a ternary operation)
