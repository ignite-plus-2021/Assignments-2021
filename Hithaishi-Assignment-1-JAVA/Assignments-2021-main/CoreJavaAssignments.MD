Q1. Write a program that takes three integer command-line arguments and prints equal if all three are equal, and not equal otherwise.

Q2. Write a Java program to sort a given binary array in linear times.
b_nums[] = { 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0 } 
Output:
After sorting: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Q3. Write a program that takes an integer command-line argument n and prints all the positive powers of 2 less than or equal to n. Make sure that your program works properly for all values of n.

Q4. What is the difference between ++i and i++

Q5. In a for loop, <initialize> and <increment> can be statements more complicated than declaring, initializing, and updating a loop-control variable. How can I take advantage of this ability?

Q6  Can I use a double variable as a loop-control variable in a for loop?

Q7 . Are there cases where I must use a for loop but not a while, or vice versa?

Q8. Write a Java program to sort an array of given integers using the Bubble sorting Algorithm and Heap sort Algorithm.

Q9. Write a program to find Leap year

Q10. Write a program GreatestCommonDivisor that finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers using Euclidâ€™s algorithm, which is an iterative computation based on the following observation: if x is greater than y, then if y divides x, the gcd of x and y is y; otherwise, the gcd of x and y is the same as the gcd of x % y and y.

Q11.Write a program converting to binary 
Input - 19
output -10011
Input - 100000000
Output - 101111101011110000100000000

Q12. Write a program Checkerboard that takes an integer command-line argument n and uses a loop nested within a loop to print out a two-dimensional n-by-n checkerboard pattern with alternating spaces and asterisks.
