Q4. What is the difference between ++i and i++
A. ++i is the pre-increment where the value of i is first incremented and then used in the expression where as i++ is called the post-increment where the value of i is used in the expression and then incremented.
Ex: a = (++i) + (++i); //pre increment
     Here if i=1 initially then two increments gives the value of i as 3 and value of a as 5 (first ++i=2 + later ++i=3)
Ex: a = (i++)+(i++);// post increment	
     Here if i=1 initially then two post increments give the value of i as 3 and value of a as 3(first i++=1 i=2; later i++=2, i=3)

Q5. In a for loop, and can be statements more complicated than declaring, initializing, and updating a loop-control variable. How can I take advantage of this ability?
A. The general form of for loop is:
	for (initialization ; condition ; updation)
	{
		//statements; execute until condition becomes false
	}
•	Apart from this general form we can have two variables initialized in intialization part seperated by a comma.
•	Two or condition may be included by or-ing (||) or and-ing (&&) them. When or-ed condition fails if both are false, true otherwise; when and-ed then condition if anyone of them is false.
      for (i=1,j=1; cond1&&cond2 ; updating)
      {
	//statements;
      }
•	The three expressions for for-loop are optional; an infinite loop can be created as follows. 
//infinite loop
for ( 		;	;	)
{
	Statements;
}
•	The for also another form which was designed for iteration through Collections and arrays.
// Enhanced for
int numbers[] ={1,2,3,4,5,6};
for (int item : numbers) 
{ 
	System.out.println (item+”  “);
}
•	Each time variable item holds the current value from the numbers array.

Q6 .Can I use a double variable as a loop-control variable in a for loop?
A. Yes,you can use double variable as a loop-control variable in such a case you separate them with comma and make sure to update two variables if not done so can lead to infinite iterations in some cases.
Ex: for (i=0,j=10;i<5,j>0;i++,j--)
      {
		System.out.println (i+” “+j);
       }
       Prints 0 10
1	9
2	8
3	7
4	6

Q7 . Are there cases where I must use a for loop but not a while, or vice versa?
A.	If we aren’t aware of the number of times the loop has to iterate but only if the condition is known, we can use a while loop instead of for. 
B.	If u don’t want to specify any condition and want the loop to iterate infinitely then you can use for loop but if you don’t include a Boolean value of expression in a while loop it results in compilation error.
C.	If u don’t want to increment the loop control variable with every iteration then you can use while loop instead of a for.
D.	However if want to execute the loop in less time then you can use while rather than for, because while is slightly faster. If  a program has large number of loops included to decrease the overhead use while.
